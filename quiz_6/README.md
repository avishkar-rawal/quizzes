# Path–Goal Leadership Questionnaire (quiz_6)

This quiz helps identify your preferred Path–Goal leadership styles: Directive, Supportive, Participative, and Achievement-oriented. It assesses how often you engage in behaviors associated with each style.

## How it works

- Scores are calculated for four distinct leadership styles, with reverse scoring applied to specific items.
- Results are visualized using:
    - A Radar Chart to show your overall style profile.
    - A Bar Chart to compare your scores for each style against defined low, moderate, and high ranges.
- An interpretation of your scores is provided to help you understand your leadership tendencies.
