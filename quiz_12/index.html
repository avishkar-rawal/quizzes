                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> The following instrument is a checklist designed to encourage you to reflect on the inclusive behaviors you exhibit in a variety of settings: meeting one-on-one with individuals, facilitating a team meeting, participating in a team meeting, and mentoring someone less experienced. In each case, you are encouraged to place a check mark in the Yes column or No column.</p>
