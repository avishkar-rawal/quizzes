                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this questionnaire is to learn about gender biases and how to become aware of them in order to break harmful stereotypes.</p>
                <p><strong>What you're rating:</strong> You will rate how important different personality characteristics are for effective leadership in general. You are NOT rating specific leaders or gender groups - just the importance of each trait for leadership.</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Below are characteristics that people might have. For each characteristic, indicate how important you think it is for someone to be an effective leader.</p>
                <p><strong>Key:</strong> 1 = Not Important | 2 = Somewhat Important | 3 = Neutral | 4 = Important | 5 = Very Important</p>

                <h3>What This Means</h3>
                <p><strong>About the characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Communal characteristics</strong> (like caring, supportive, understanding) are traditionally associated with women</li>
                    <li><strong>Agentic characteristics</strong> (like dominant, assertive, controlling) are traditionally associated with men</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many people are surprised to find they unconsciously favor traditional "male" leadership traits over "female" ones, even when this conflicts with their stated values. This test reveals unconscious biases that can disadvantage women in leadership roles.</p>
                <p>Understanding these biases is the first step toward creating more inclusive leadership environments that value diverse leadership styles.</p>
